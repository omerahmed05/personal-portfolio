                  I played a crucial role in refining the software architecture. By replacing regular expressions (RegEx) with JavaParser, we achieved a notable reduction in code execution time, significantly enhancing the tool's performance.&nbsp;
                  In addition, I supported a study analyzing the effectiveness of AI tools for debugging. This research provided valuable insights into user preferences and the efficacy of various debugging methodologies. My active involvement in lab discussions was instrumental, as I provided feedback on research papers and helped ensure the high quality of our research outputs.&nbsp;
                  For my personal study on "AI Tools vs. Debugging Tools: Exploring User Perceptions on Bug Locating Performance," I received significant recognition, securing 1st Place at the VAâ€“NC Alliance Undergraduate Research Symposium and 2nd Place at the Dr. Wayne Scales Undergraduate Research Symposium. This research shed light on how users perceive the efficiency and ease of use of different debugging tools, offering valuable contributions to the academic understanding of debugging methodologies.

              As a Software Engineer at <strong>Xylem Inc.</strong>, I developed a real-time timeline view for the RNI Scheduler, a critical application for managing jobs on Remote Network Interface (RNI) servers that facilitate smart utility readings and reports.&nbsp;
              {showMore.xylem ? (
                <>
                  Utilizing Angular, FullCalendar, and REST APIs, I transformed the scheduler's user interface from a static tabular format to a dynamic, visually intuitive timeline. To ensure data accuracy and efficiency, the REST API was designed to invoke stored procedures in the company's SQL database using JDBC, fetching real-time job information.&nbsp;
                  The new timeline view provides users with a clear overview of job interactions, enabling them to effectively track and manage tasks across the RNI network. For instance, long-running report generation processes, which can consume substantial memory and processing power, are now clearly visible, preventing users from accidentally initiating duplicate jobs. By visually indicating the status of jobs, including those with long runtimes like report generation, the timeline prevents unnecessary resource consumption and reduces system load. This enhanced visibility has significantly improved operational efficiency, decreased wait times for users, and minimized support inquiries related to job status.

                  As a Software Engineer Intern at Bank of New York, I enhanced a legacy disclosure generation system by exporting metadata from MongoDB Compass and developing Python scripts to restructure JSON data, enabling seamless frontend integration. I designed and implemented RESTful APIs in Java using Spring Boot to efficiently retrieve and deliver transformed metadata from MongoDB collections to the frontend, improving system performance and maintainability. I gained hands-on exposure to CI/CD pipelines and containerized applications, learning how containers are used to package and deploy services reliably and how updates flow from development through testing to deployment. Working within an Agile team, I tracked progress and coordinated tasks through Jira, participating in sprint planning, code reviews, and iterative development cycles. I also strengthened application security by remediating over 10 critical vulnerabilities flagged by SonarQube, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), insecure deserialization, and outdated dependencies. This experience allowed me to apply full-stack development, database management, and secure development practices in a collaborative, high-stakes financial services environment.
